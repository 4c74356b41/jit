            # JiT service principals
            ## for ci\cd pipelines 

            -----
            
            ### Current situation
            - ~100 service principals currently in use
            - accounts can not be linked to owners
            - account names are not following the same naming scheme
            - service principal names are meaningless guids
            - service principals cant easily be linked to service connections
            - not following "least security principle"
            - no review process (hard to implement one)
            
            -----
            
            ### Risks with maintaining existing solution
            
            ---
            
            #### Scaling issues
            
            it will get progressively harder to maintain existing solution as we scale as the process is 100% manual
            
            ---
            
            #### Miss usage and permission sprawl
            
            right now there 12 different service connections role assignments on production subscription
            
            ---
            
            #### Extensive attack surface
            
            each service principal carries a risk of being compromised. potentially even a dev one can have access to production subscriptions
     
            -----
            
            ### Proposed solution
            
            Just-in-Time service principals generated during the build and destroyed right after the build finishes 
            
            -----
            
            ### Benefits of JiT approach
            
            - fully automated approach that can scale almost indefinitely
            - short-lived service principals with certificate authentication
            - follows "least security principle"
            - pipeline permissions are easily auditable
            - virtually no attack surface and no permission sprawl
            - merge multiple common tasks into one (arm, bicep, export variables, etc)
            - relatively easy migration path

            ### Architecture

            ### TODO
            
            -----
            
            ### Downsides
            
            - needs migration (effort from developers and infrastructure team)
            - needs development time from infrastructure team
            - introduces external dependencies to pipelines
            - still possible to use maliciously (can somewhat be mitigated in code)
